                  <p>I'm a form 6 vaccist, I've never been gainfully employed but have worked in a
                  very organised administrative structure so I can say I can manage any managerial task whatsoever because my mind is coded for such</p>
                  <p>Hey there! This is my landing page and have all the fun you wanna.
                  Thing is its my first not-so-close-to-a website attempt and it has been really irritating mostly because of small mistakes that
                can take you over an hour to locate and correct but its has been fun altogether.</p>
                  <p>I love taking lots of milk, I've always had this desire to gym and become
                    super mugged.
                    And for a hobby I'd say I sing, but just because I said I sing does not mean I can actually sing.</p>

                  <p>I desired to start oun on Moringa school's program beacuse I know it's ust what I need
                  or lemme say the best way for me to start out on my career path as a software developer-tech mogul.
                  I mean who knows what a million light years from earth to the closest galaxy to earth would feel like to travel?
                  There's always has to be a first time for something never done before</p>
